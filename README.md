**Ten Practical Ways Mathematics Solves Everyday Problems**

1. **Budgeting with Basic Arithmetic:** Use simple calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to manage income, expenses, and savings. A well-structured budget is the cornerstone of sound personal finance.

2. **Optimization with Linear Programming:** To maximize the use of time, resources, or money, linear programming helps you determine the best outcome given specific constraints, making planning more efficient.

3. **Probability for Decision Making:** Understanding the probability of events, such as the likelihood of rain, helps in making everyday decisions, like whether to carry an umbrella or not.

4. **Statistics for Data Analysis:** Averages, medians, and standard deviations are tools for interpreting data—be it for analyzing poll results or monitoring personal health trends—allowing for informed decisions.

5. **Geometry for Space Planning:** Geometry aids in efficiently arranging furniture, planning a garden, or any task involving space management and the shapes of objects.

6. **Fractions and Ratios for Cooking:** Scaling recipes to cater to different numbers of guests often involves using fractions and ratios to adjust ingredient quantities correctly.

7. **Scale and Proportion for DIY Projects:** Whether you’re building furniture, crafting, or mixing paint, understanding scale and proportion ensures that everything fits and works together as intended.

8. **Algebra for Problem Solving:** Algebraic equations are valuable tools for various problems, like calculating the time required to complete a task at a given rate, thus providing clear solutions.

9. **Time Management with Timelines:** Organize projects by breaking them into smaller, timed tasks using timelines, which helps in managing time effectively and meeting deadlines.

10. **Graph Theory for Routing:** Planning an optimal route for errands or deliveries is made simpler with graph theory, which identifies the shortest or most efficient path among multiple locations.

**1. Budgeting with Basic Arithmetic**

*Example:* You have a monthly income of $3,000. Your expenses include rent ($1,200), groceries ($400), utilities ($200), and entertainment ($150). How much can you save each month?

*Steps and Formula:*
- Total Expenses = Rent + Groceries + Utilities + Entertainment
  \[
  \text{Total Expenses} = 1200 + 400 + 200 + 150 = 1950
  \]
- Savings = Income - Total Expenses
  \[
  \text{Savings} = 3000 - 1950 = 1050
  \]
So, you can save $1,050 each month.

**2. Optimization with Linear Programming**

*Example:* You run a bakery and want to maximize profit by deciding how many cakes (profit = $10 each) and cookies (profit = $2 each) to bake. You have a constraint of 10 hours available, with cakes taking 2 hours each and cookies 1 hour each.

*Steps and Formula:*
- Objective Function: Maximize Profit = \(10x + 2y\)
- Constraints:
  \[
  2x + y \leq 10 \quad \text{(time constraint)}
  \]
  \[
  x, y \geq 0 \quad \text{(non-negativity)}
  \]
  
Using a graph or solver, you find:
- Maximum profit occurs at \(x = 3, y = 4\).
- Profit = \(10(3) + 2(4) = 30 + 8 = 38\).

So, bake 3 cakes and 4 cookies for maximum profit.

---

**3. Probability for Decision Making**

*Example:* The weather forecast predicts a 70% chance of rain. Should you take an umbrella if getting wet costs you $20 and the inconvenience of carrying an umbrella costs $5?

*Steps and Formula:*
- Expected Cost if you take an umbrella: $5.
- Expected Cost if you don’t take an umbrella:
  \[
  0.7 \times 20 + 0.3 \times 0 = 14
  \]

Since $14 (not taking an umbrella) is more than $5 (taking an umbrella), it’s better to take the umbrella.

---

**4. Statistics for Data Analysis**

*Example:* You have test scores: 70, 80, 90, 85, 75. What is the average score?

*Steps and Formula:*
- Average (Mean) = Sum of Scores / Number of Scores
  \[
  \text{Average} = \frac{70 + 80 + 90 + 85 + 75}{5} = \frac{400}{5} = 80
  \]

So, the average score is 80.

---

**5. Geometry for Space Planning**

*Example:* You want to fit a rectangular table (2m x 1.5m) in a room that's 4m x 3m, keeping at least 0.5m distance from the walls.

*Steps and Formula:*
- Calculate available space:
  \[
  \text{Available Length} = 4 - 2 \times 0.5 = 3 \, \text{m}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Available Width} = 3 - 2 \times 0.5 = 2 \, \text{m}
  \]

The table fits since it’s 2m x 1.5m, and the available space is 3m x 2m.

---

**6. Fractions and Ratios for Cooking**

*Example:* A recipe for 4 people requires 2 cups of flour. How much flour is needed for 6 people?

*Steps and Formula:*
- Ratio Calculation:
  \[
  \frac{6}{4} = 1.5
  \]
- Flour Needed = 2 cups × 1.5
  \[
  = 3 \, \text{cups}
  \]

You need 3 cups of flour for 6 people.

---

**7. Scale and Proportion for DIY Projects**

*Example:* You’re making a smaller model of a bookshelf that’s originally 180 cm tall and 90 cm wide. You want the model to be 1/3 the size.

*Steps and Formula:*
- Scale Factor = 1/3
- New Height:
  \[
  180 \times \frac{1}{3} = 60 \, \text{cm}
  \]
- New Width:
  \[
  90 \times \frac{1}{3} = 30 \, \text{cm}
  \]

The scaled model will be 60 cm tall and 30 cm wide.

---

**8. Algebra for Problem Solving**

*Example:* You are filling a pool with water at a rate of 15 liters per minute. How long will it take to fill a 900-liter pool?

*Steps and Formula:*
- Let \( t \) be the time in minutes.
- Rate × Time = Total Volume
  \[
  15t = 900
  \]
  \[
  t = \frac{900}{15} = 60
  \]

It will take 60 minutes to fill the pool.

---

**9. Time Management with Timelines**

*Example:* You have a project that includes 3 tasks: A (2 hours), B (1 hour), and C (1.5 hours). What’s the total time required?

*Steps and Formula:*
- Total Time = Sum of Task Times
  \[
  \text{Total Time} = 2 + 1 + 1.5 = 4.5 \, \text{hours}
  \]

Plan for 4.5 hours to complete all tasks.

---

**10. Graph Theory for Routing**

*Example:* You need to visit three locations: A, B, and C. The distances are: A to B = 5 km, A to C = 10 km, B to C = 4 km. What’s the shortest route?

*Steps and Formula:*
- Possible Routes:
  - A → B → C: \(5 + 4 = 9 \, \text{km}\)
  - A → C → B: \(10 + 4 = 14 \, \text{km}\)
  - B → A → C: \(5 + 10 = 15 \, \text{km}\)

The shortest route is A → B → C, totaling 9 km.
